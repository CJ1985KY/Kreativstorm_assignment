You are performing an applicaiton at a company. You are asked to do an interview challenge task in specific steps. It involves a structured analysis of IKEA India's internal alignment challenges using the Deloitte-Marzo 9S Matrix. This framework builds on the classic 7-S model, providing a more complete view of how different parts of an organization align. Your task is to develop a clear, well-organized analysis that can support discussion and decision-making in a case study setting. 

What you will have to do - step by step:
Step 1: List all 9 "S" dimensions.
Step 2: For each of the 9 "S" dimensions write 2-3 sentences identifying key misalignments at IKEA India. Use specific, observable evidence from the case study PDF. Focus on clarity and relevance - not textbook theory.
Step 3: In 100-200 words, answer the following question: "How do the two Marzo additions reveal alignment issues that the classic 7-S model would likely overlook?"
Step 4: Reflect on how misalignment spreads in complex systems. In 100-200 words, answer the following: "How does influence flow between key elements in the organization, and how does this affect overall alignment in the IKEA India case?"
Your response in step 4 should reflect:
- How misalignment in one area can influence others
- Where structural or cultural friction might originate and propagate
Step 5: For each "S" element, suggest one specific action IKEA India could take to improve alignment in that area. For step 5:
- Your recommendation should be practical and relevant to the challenges described in the case
- Keep each response brief and focused - no more than 1-2 sentences per "S"

You are to perform these 5 steps, and return your result. To perform this task, you need the IKEA Case Study Information. It is given follows:

### **Case study task - IKEA India: Organizational alignment challenges**

*Note: The information in this case combines real and fictionalized data to allow for deeper organizational analysis. This is a simulation used strictly for candidate evaluation purposes.*

**Background**

In August 2018, IKEA opened its first Indian store in Hyderabad after years of preparation, legal structuring, and supply chain groundwork. The company publicly announced plans to invest over €1.4 billion in India to support a multi-city expansion, supported by a combination of company-owned outlets and online fulfilment centers. Initial media and consumer response was strong, with 40,000+ visitors on opening day and significant brand visibility in Tier 1 urban markets.

However, within two years of launch, multiple signs of organizational strain began to emerge - ranging from inconsistent execution and leadership turnover to delayed market entry in other cities. While IKEA remained committed to its long-term growth in India, by late 2020 the company acknowledged in internal strategy reviews that it had "underestimated the alignment complexity required for sustainable market adaptation."

**Key context and internal data**

**Sales and product-market fit:**

* After Q1 2019, footfall decreased by 34% compared to launch quarter averages.
* Large-format products such as wardrobes, kitchen modules, and multipurpose cabinets underperformed by 60-70% of forecast, despite high visibility in promotions.
* Local consumer interviews revealed misalignment between typical apartment dimensions and European-standard furniture sizes.
* Over 45% of in-store purchases were from small home accessories or food court items, vs. the expected 30-35%.
* Online sales conversion remained under 1.5% in pilot regions due to long delivery windows, unclear assembly guarantees, and inconsistent item availability.

**Talent and organizational structure:**

* IKEA India's regional offices operated with dual reporting lines - locally to country heads, and vertically to global functional leaders.
* Middle management turnover reached 24.7% within 18 months, particularly among store operations, HR, and logistics.
* Exit interviews cited: unclear escalation procedures, limited ability to localize procedures, and high pressure from HQ KPIs that didn't account for market variance.
* Role duplication between store-level planning teams and global merchandising caused friction over inventory planning decisions.
* Several teams operated on overlapping KPIs: one team responsible for pricing, another for promotional strategy - without shared ownership of revenue targets.

**Sourcing, compliance, and supply chain:**

* India's FDI regulations required 30% local sourcing. IKEA had to restructure over 25% of its global vendor relationships to meet compliance.
* More than 60 SKUs were pulled from the Hyderabad launch plan due to supplier-side delays or import clearance issues.
* The onboarding of local vendors increased QA rejection rates to 8.2%, compared to the 1.4% global average.
* Supply chain planning was further slowed by fragmented systems: Indian fulfilment used a different inventory platform than IKEA's global one, with no automated integration until 2021.
* Rework and delays affected new store construction timelines in Mumbai and Bengaluru, both of which missed target launch dates by more than 12 months.

**Internal communication and leadership:**

* In a 2020 alignment pulse survey:
    * Only 39% of Indian team members said they clearly understood the decision-making chain for operational changes.
    * Just 32% felt that input from local teams was "seriously considered" by global management.
    * 41% of store managers felt overwhelmed by the volume of internal reporting without clear follow-up or feedback loops.

---

* Global strategy communications were often published on European schedules, missing Indian reporting cycles and causing confusion around priorities.
* A "One IKEA Way" operations manual was distributed company-wide but criticized locally for lack of flexibility.

**Cultural integration and identity:**

* IKEA's internal values ("togetherness", "simplicity", "lead by example") were seen as too abstract in a market where new hires often came from traditional, hierarchical firms.
* Employees reported tension between legacy global hires and local managers - creating informal silos.
* Training sessions were delayed repeatedly due to lack of localized materials and translated content.
* The company initiated "India Market Labs" to develop local product formats in 2020, but the initiative lacked dedicated cross-functional staffing and was paused after six months.

**Public performance:**

* Net Promoter Score (NPS) declined from 74 (Q1 2019) to 59 (Q3 2021), particularly among families and first-time buyers.
* Analysts began labelling IKEA India as a "slow burn" market with uncertain scalability.
* In 2021 investor calls, IKEA executives pointed to "organizational coordination challenges" as a key barrier to deeper regional expansion.
